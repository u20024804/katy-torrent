## Installation instructions
(Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed!)
1. cd to project folder
2. sudo npm install
3. sudo npm start
## To-Do-List
(Sorted by priority)
1. Must enable smooth seeding of as many torrents as possible (At the moment, having more than 40+ torrents seeding will slow down the program!).
2. Must load the files from a user-defined folder, not from /tmp
3. Must be able to delete torrents, stop, pause, etc.
4. Must be able to allow remote HTTP connections so that it can act as a seedbox, remote uploading of torrents into Node.js webserver.
