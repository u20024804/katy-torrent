# katy-torrent v0.1
# The goal of this project is to create an ultra-lightweight WebTorrent client that uses the least amount of system resources as possible, in order to facilitate long-term seeding of multiple torrents.
# WebTorrent is a tool that holds a lot of potential. Sadly, high CPU and memory usage, as well as the sudden interruption of the seeding process, is a major reason why it hasn't been adopted by the mainstream filesharing community.
